// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a data format that is inspired by the way we define
// Javascript Object Literals. There are two main differences between JSON and a JS Object Literal:
// 1) The properties/keys of a JSON object must be wrapped in "", that is, it must be a string. The values must be one of the following javascript primitive types: string, number, boolean, null (no undefineds!)
// 2) They cannot contain functions!

// Node can convert a JSON into a Javascript object and vise versa
